# Helpdesk Service

**Helpdesk**, also referred to as Technical Support or Service Desk, is a service structure that handles user issues related to both hardware and software aspects of computers and office equipment.

#### Methodology of Organizing a Helpdesk Service

The configuration of a technical support service can vary across different enterprises. Several models exist, such as centralized, local, virtual, and unified call center approaches. The technical support service can be established for the purpose of serving external clients (outsourcing computer support, etc.) or internal clients (a subunit within the IT department of large enterprises).

A well-organized Help Desk service always starts with registering all user inquiries, serving as a single point of communication between users and the IT service. Popular practical solutions often build on the foundation of a Call Center (a term that users occasionally conflate with Help Desk). It is the initial contact point for end-users with the technical support service and provides feedback on their satisfaction with the service level, supplementing information about the technical quality of service for the client company (external or internal).

In large enterprises or prominent outsourcing companies, the technical support service is frequently structured with a multi-level approach:

- **User** — Contacts the support service by phone or through electronic requests (email or specialized request services like Helpdesk service).
- **Operator** (1st support line, Call Center) — Records the inquiry, assists the user if possible, or escalates the request to the second support line.
- **Second Support Line** — Receives requests from the first line, processes them, and involves specialists from related departments if necessary (system administrators, POS terminal support, specialized software or equipment support, billing system administrators, etc.).
